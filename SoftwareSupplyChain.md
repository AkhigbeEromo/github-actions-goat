# Software Supply Chain Security 

A software supply chain is anything that affects, modifies or goes into your code from development to production deployment through a CI/CD pipeline. A software supply chain includes: who wrote it, when it was contributed, how it’s been reviewed for security issues, known vulnerabilities, supported versions, license information, etc. A software supply chain also encompasses other parts of the stack beyond a single application, including the build and packaging scripts or the software running the infrastructure the application runs on. A software supply chain also includes any information you want to know about the software you’re running to help you determine any risks in running it.
